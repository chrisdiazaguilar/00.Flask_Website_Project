industries, Cyber Security, while also incorporating some wordplay. I drew inspiration from my experience working in 
tech as well as from consuming media such as Mr. Robot and the classic movie Hackers. I also included the word 
“Custcatlan,” which comes from El Salvador and means “Land of the Jewel.” In today’s world, personal data is like 
precious jewels that need to be protected from malicious actors. 

Furthermore, in the lower portion of the text, I played with words by stating “Securing Cyber Pup space Since 2024.” 
The term “Pup” is a security term that stands for Potential Unwanted Programs. I felt that this was an easter 
egg for those who understood the term.""",
